To Use:
Run the application and you will be prompted to enter a url. Choose a desired url then copy & paste into terminal. From then, the code should return a title, the website's paragraphs and all possible links. 
If such error codes appear: 404, 400, 401, 403, 429, 500. You've exceeded your limited attempts or the webiste's privacy policy prevents the website from being scraped. Therefore, you need to run the application with different url.
